# Machine-Learning-Particle-Identification

This is a project I did senior year of college where I used a machine learning approach to aid in my physics research. Please refer to the PDF for a detailed description of the project. I also attached some of the codes I used to perform the data visualization and the machine learning. 

Through this I have demonstrated the following skills: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, data visualization, logistic regression, including using polynomial features, and confusion matrices.
